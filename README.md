Machine Learning: Classification of data using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This assignment aims at solving the Classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) by making use of different techniques like Linear SVM using Soft and Hard Margins, kernel-based SVM using polynomial and Gaussian Kernel function. The Classification problem is to fit the models according to the datasets and classify the test data accordingly. The implementation tries to design a model in such a way that it will try to fit datasets and produces low testing data errors. The implementation includes different datasets, 10-Fold Cross validation for training and test datasets, different number of features and classes is used for classification (2-D 2-Class problems).

<h3>STEPS TO RUN: </h3>
  1. Run svm.py using, python svm.py
  2. Prompt for Input will appear for dataset to be used and kernel to be used.
  3. Input these values and the results will be displayed.
